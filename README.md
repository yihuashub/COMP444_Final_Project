# COMP444_Final_Project

Hi, guys. My project is about a fire finder robot. Under normal conditions, it will use an ultrasonic sensor to evade obstacles and patrol an area. Once the robot finds a fire, it will immediately stop and sending a fire alarm signal to the controller to trigger a fire alert.
